<p>Dont want your columns to simply stack in smaller devices? Use the extra small and\n              medium device grid classes by adding <code>.col-xs-*</code> <code>.col-md-*</code> to\n              your columns. See the example below for a better idea of how it all works.\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"row show-grid\">\n              <div className=\"col-xs-12 col-md-8\">.col-xs-12 .col-md-8</div>\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-md-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"row show-grid\">\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-md-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-md-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-md-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"row show-grid\">\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6\">.col-xs-6</div>\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6\">.col-xs-6</div>\n            </div>\n          </Panel>\n\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"row\">\n        <div className=\"col-lg-12\">\n\n          <Panel>\n            <h3>Example: Mobile, tablet, desktops</h3>\n            <p>Build on the previous example by creating even more dynamic and powerful\n              layouts with tablet <code>.col-sm-*</code> classes.</p>\n            <div className=\"row show-grid\">\n              <div className=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8\">.col-xs-12 .col-sm-6 .col-md-8</div>\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-md-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"row show-grid\">\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-sm-4</div>\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-sm-4</div>\n              <div className=\"clearfix visible-xs\" />\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-sm-4</div>\n            </div>\n          </Panel>\n\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"row\">\n        <div className=\"col-lg-12\">\n\n          <Panel>\n            <h3 id=\"grid-responsive-resets\">Responsive column resets</h3>\n            <p>With the four tiers of grids available you're bound to run into issues where, at\n              certain breakpoints, your columns don't clear quite right as one is taller than the\n              other.

  Morris.js is a jQuery based charting plugin created by Olly Smith. In SB Admin,\n                we are using the most recent version of Morris.js which includes the resize\n                functions, which makes the charts fully responsive. The documentation for\n                Morris.js is available on their website,\n                <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/\" >\n                  'http://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/'\n                </a>.\n              </p>\n              <Button bsSize=\"large\" block href=\"http://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/\">\n                View Morris.js Documentation\n              </Button>\n            </div>\n          </Panel>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\ndisplayMorrisjsCharts.contextTypes = { setTitle: PropTypes.func.isRequired };\n\nexport default displayMorrisjsCharts;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./routes/dashboardPages/morrisjsCharts/MorrisjsCharts.js","\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Notification from './Notification';\n\nexport default {\n\n  path: '/notification',\n\n  action() {\n    return <Notification />;\n  },\n\n};\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./routes/dashboardPages/notification/index.js","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Panel from 'react-bootstrap/lib/Panel';\nimport Alert from 'react-bootstrap/lib/Alert';\nimport Button from 'react-bootstrap/lib/Button';\nimport OverlayTrigger from 'react-bootstrap/lib/OverlayTrigger';\nimport Tooltip from 'react-bootstrap/lib/Tooltip';\nimport Popover from 'react-bootstrap/lib/Popover';\nimport Modal, { Footer, Header, Title, Body } from 'react-bootstrap/lib/Modal';\nimport PageHeader from 'react-bootstrap/lib/PageHeader';\n\n\nclass Notification extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      alertVisibleA: true,\n      alertVisibleB: true,\n      alertVisibleC: true,\n      alertVisibleD: true,\n      showModal: false,\n    };\n    this.handleAlertDismiss = this.handleAlertDismiss.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  close() {\n    this.setState({ showModal: false });\n  }\n\n  open() {\n    this.setState({ showModal: true });\n  }\n  handleAlertDismiss(option) {\n    switch (option) {\n      case 'A':\n        this.setState({ alertVisibleA: false });\n        break;\n      case 'B':\n        this.setState({ alertVisibleB: false });\n        break;\n      case 'C':\n        this.setState({ alertVisibleC: false });\n        break;\n      case 'D':\n        this.setState({ alertVisibleD: false });\n        break;\n      default: this.setState({\n        alertVisibleA: false,\n        alertVisibleB: false,\n        alertVisibleC: false,\n        alertVisibleD: false,\n      });\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n\n        <div className=\"row\">\n          <div className=\"col-lg-12\">\n            <PageHeader>Notifications</PageHeader>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"row\">\n          <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\n            <Panel header={<span>Alert Styles</span>} >\n              <Alert bsStyle=\"success\">\n                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.\n                <a\n                  href=\"\"\n                  onClick={(e) => { e.preventDefault();
